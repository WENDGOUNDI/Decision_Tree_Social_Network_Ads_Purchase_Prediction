# Decision Tree Social Network Ads Purchase Prediction

Social media advertising can be a powerful tool for driving purchases and increasing revenue for businesses. Nowadays, companies invest a consideral amount of money for adds to promote their products, increase their popularity as well as their sales. With the advent of technology, machine learning through historical data, can help curating the target list. In this project, using decision tree model, we train a model that takes as input the user gender, age and estimated salary and predict if a given customer may purchase the product through the adds.
